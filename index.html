				<p>Klemflastic Sound provides mastering services specifically tailored to the strengths of both digital and analog playback. We are fully capable of mastering in contemplation of a master for either a glass CD or vinyl lacquer.</p>
				<div id="masterNav"></div>
				</div>
				<div id="approach" class="about" style="display:none;">
				<p class="masteringText">Klemflastic Sound sees mastering as a balance of both technical and artistic decisions to ready an artist's recording for mass production. By analyzing the recording in a controlled, high fidelity environment, adjustments can be made to improve the program's clarity and impact, as well as create a comprehensive/cohesive 'flow' to a record. This is accomplished via a variety of methods that focus on frequency, dynamics, and stereo field/width, in addition to sequencing, establishing fades, and checking the master disc for errors. While considerations must be made in regards to the final format (uncompressed digital or vinyl, for example), signal-processing decisions are also based on (and ultimately decided by) the artist's aesthetic.</p>
				</div>
				<div id="bio" class="about" style="display:none;">
					<p class="masteringText">Patrick Klem has taught audio engineering at multiple colleges, provided community DIY production workshops/tutorials, rebuilt a studio, and served in a variety of consultative roles. Past clients repeatedly comment on his technical focus and creative abilities as an engineer, as well as his solid work ethic and adaptability. As an independent engineer with over 15 years experience, Patrick readily takes the time to work with clients on all aspects of mastering decisions until the visualized end product is reached. There is no 'one size fits all' process, or a 'my way or the highway' approach. Patrick Klem focuses on engendering the artist's aesthetic by combining technical acumen with detailed communication, which results in a <a href="#cory"><i>"stellar sounding end product."</i></a> Complete client satisfaction with the final recording is the ultimate goal at Klemflastic Sound.

				<div id="mastering" class="about" style="display:none;overflow:hidden;">
					<div id="mastering1" class="masteringOverlay">
						<h2>Why Master?</h2><p class="masteringText">Mastering is not just for large budget professional recordings. As audio technology becomes more widely available, far more recordings are being created in sub-optimal conditions. Consequently, professional mastering has become an indispensable link to an excellent sounding record. Mastering helps an album reach its full potential in a number of ways:</p>
					</div>
					<div id="mastering2" class="masteringOverlay">
						<h2>Mix evaluation</h2><p class="masteringText">Mixes are evaluated in a sonically clean, purpose-built space. The dedicated mastering environment (high-fidelity signal chain, accurate monitor placement and room treatment) often reveal details and aspects of the track that are not readily apparent during the mixing process.  (If there are issues that are best addressed in the mixing stage, and remixes are still an option, we will walk the client through the steps to create better mixes.) </p>
					</div>
					<div id="mastering3" class="masteringOverlay">
						<h2>Error correction</h2><p class="masteringText">Digital noise, be it clicks, crackling, or drop-outs can be corrected. Degraded analog recordings can often be restored to reveal clarity and detail masked by distortion.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="mastering4" class="masteringOverlay">
						<h2>Sonic improvement</h2><p class="masteringText">We apply processing (under the 'first do no harm' credo) that ensures the record will be as robust (tonally, dynamically, spatially and temporally) as possible on the widest variety of playback systems, from earbuds to car speakers to audiophile setups. Well researched processors are used to apply equalization, compression, expansion, limiting, de-essing, stereo field editing, etc. to best serve the artist's intentions. Attention to detail and the support/extension of the artist's intent and aesthetic is paramount.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="mastering5" class="masteringOverlay">
						<h2>Creation of a cohesive narrative</h2><p class="masteringText">Fades, transitions, and leveling ensure songs flow naturally from each other. This is especially important when songs are recorded or mixed in multiple environments.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="mastering6" class="masteringOverlay">
						<h2>Quality control</h2><p class="masteringText">Mastering is your last chance to catch any errors that may have been missed during mixing.  Errors range far and wide, from incorrectly interfacing multiple digital devices (word clocks) to C2 errors on the production master CD.  Masters that leave Klemflastic are ready for error-free replication (CDs) and lacquer cutting.  We prepare masters that are trouble-free for the lacquer cutter or CD replication plant.  To boot, we follow through with the lacquer cutter to ensure the mixes are reproduced as accurately as possible, and are also happy to evaluate test pressings on a true reference phonograph system.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="mastering7" class="masteringOverlay">
						<h2>Isn't all this done at the plant?</h2><p class="masteringText">Most indie label vinyl records are created as a 'flat' cut.  This means the lacquer cutter will adjust the program for the vinyl medium if there are glaring issues that wreak havoc on the cutting stylus (e.g., wide stereo image in the low Hertz, strong transients > 7kHz, etc.), but nothing else.  Although this process is technically called 'mastering', it offers NONE of the benefits described here. More info on the vinyl medium is available <a target="_blank"  href="considerations.pdf">here</a></p>

						<h2>Klemflastic is mastering for the people; a stronger record at a modest price.</h2><p class="masteringText">Some mastering houses with expansive gear lists churn out amazing products. Conversely, there are just as many that butcher the mixes. <strong>Gear lists are secondary to an engineer's inherent knowledge, abilities, and communication.</strong> Of course, mastering does require certain high-end baseline equipment and an excellent environment in which to work, but we highly encourage you to have a talk with any potential mastering engineer to look beyond an expensive gear list (and rates!). </p>
					</div>
					<div id="room" class="gearOverlay gear" style="display:none;">
						<h2>Room</h2><p class="masteringText">Mastering requires an excellent sounding acoustical environment. Without it, the engineer is, hyperbolically, driving in a sandstorm. An (arguably ridiculously) obsessive amount of time was placed on creating the most neutral room possible to operate Klemflastic. Through measuring, consulting, bass traps / sound absorption of various types, diffusors, and too much math, we've created a room that is free from flutter echo without bass build up, has excellent stereo imaging, and affected a large reduction in any peaks and nulls in the frequency response of the room.</p>

							<h2>Format</h2><p class="masteringText" style="width:450px;">We accept CDs/DVDs and DATs. Analog tapes can be accepted with advance notification.  Mixes should be printed as 24 bit word length, and use whatever sample rate it was originally recorded at (i.e., don't up/downsample it); we can accept sample rates up to 192kHz. Audio CDs or 44.1kHz/16 bit files are fine, they just provide a lower resolution. Data files are preferred to audio CDs, however, do not create a data CD by creating data files from the audio CD ('ripping' the disc). Only send data files that are created by mixing ('bouncing to disk' in Pro Tools). We can accept stereo interleaved or dual mono. Please mix them in a consistent manner, i.e., no varying sample rates, bit length, or file formats (make them all '*.wav' or '*.aiff'). Do not send anything in a lossy format (e.g., mp3s).</p>
						</div>
						<div id="prep2" class="prepOverlay">
							<h2>Content</h2><p class="masteringText" style="width:450px;">Above all else, please leave some headroom in the mixes - i.e., keep the levels from peaking at -0.0dB (no clipping/red on the meters).  Ideally, the mixes won't exceed -6dB (with an even lower RMS).  The more you excessively limit (or compress) the mix in order to increase volume, the more you constrain the mastering process, as well as the cutting engineer's ability to do anything but create a quieter and more distorted record!  We will ensure the final product is at a 'competitive' volume / holds up fine next to other modern records, but also retains  life and dynamics.  Additionally, if going to vinyl, it's a good idea to mind the stereo image of the low frequencies.  Keeping low end content more in the center of the stereo field allows for a louder cut and helps avoid skips in a record.  Of course, if a wide stereo image is important to the song, leave it as is - it just means the record will have to be cut at a lower volume.  Stereo image has no affect on digital formats (CDs, mp3s, etc.).  More info on the vinyl medium is available <a target="_blank"  href="considerations.pdf">here</a>.</p>
							</div>
							<div id="prep3" class="prepOverlay">
							<h2>Content (cont.)</h2><p class="masteringText" style="width:450px;"><strong>A squashed mix is essentially unmasterable.</strong> EQ (which practically every song will benefit from) will add grainy distortion to a heavily limited mix, regardless of whether the EQ is additive or subtractive. EQ will not help add any punch or depth to the recording at this point. Furthermore, EQ changes the wave's crest ratio, so a heavily limited mix will only come back quieter (or have to be limited again = double the distortion). Clipping and limiting should always occur after EQ, if ever. <strong>Abuse of limiters is one of the most common (and easily preventable) sources of lousy sounding music.</strong></p>
						</div>
						<div id="prep4" class="prepOverlay">
							<h2>Delivery</h2><p class="masteringText" style="width:450px;">Files are accepted electronically or via postal service.  If sending electronically, please zip files (this ensures good file integrity), and use a web-based FTP app like <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.sendspace.com">Sendspace</a> to upload them.  If you are keen on <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.getdropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, we are happy to set up a folder to share, which is also nice for easy retrieval of samples of the mastered tracks.  Private FTP service will eventually be available as well.  If sending through postal service, please contact Klemflastic Sound for the mailing address.</p>
							<p class="masteringText" style="width:450px;">Please include a txt file of any notes you have for the mastering process - be sure to include track order!  This helps us work closely with each artist to make sure we're engendering his/her goals for the mastering process.  While we can certainly work without input, it's never a bad thing to have information about specific ideas or goals for the mastering process, fades and transitions, etc.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="prep5" class="prepOverlay">
						<h2>Questions?</h2><p class="masteringText" style="width:450px;">We are happy to answer any questions to help ensure your mixes are well prepared for the mastering process. Feel free to drop us a line. There's no obligation or fee here - we consider this working towards the greater good of improved audio fidelity.

He brought out a lot of definition to the record as well as elimination of a lot of the unnecessary low end rumble. During the work on this first project together, Patrick exhibited a keen ear for assessing the music and pinpointing what needed to be worked on to make the record stronger based on the aesthetic of the recording. <strong>He asked us questions that obviously made me feel like he listened closely and was trying to understand not only the music but the feel of the recording.</strong> Since then, we have used him on almost all the projects following that record.

							<p>"Working with Patrick was a pleasure. He recorded our band on-site--mostly live--in an unfamiliar (to him) environment simply because it was comfortable for us. Despite the cramped, dead-sounding conditions, Patrick's mic'ing ingenuity and deliberate, thoughtful approach to mixing made the finished recordings sound surprisingly lively and vital (and in fact they will be released as our next EP).</p>
							<p>Patrick's patience and ability to calmly and quickly deal with the inevitable snags (technical, performance-wise, and otherwise) made the session seem fun, productive, and relaxed--even when problems arose.</p>
							<p>Aesthetically, Patrick's ear is perfectly suited for recording any 21st-century post-punk or noisy music (and probably countless other styles of music); <strong>he immediately understood our music and what kind of sounds we wanted.</strong> He has an encyclopedic knowledge of esoteric bands that I consider important and influential to our band, as well as the canonical punk/indie/"alternative" artists that any thoughtful fan of modern music should have.</p>
							<p>Recording our latest record with Patrick is certainly among my most fun and productive recording experiences."</p>

							<p>"Patrick Klem has been around the Louisville music scene for most of the time I've been playing music. He's always been incredibly generous - making live recordings, mastering tracks... even loaning me an 8 track recorder. While living outside of the city he's helped me out on a number of album recordings - including Rachel's and Shipping News projects. Patrick shares his huge enthusiasm about music and recognizes the need to support independent artists. And <strong>he has an extremely gross sense of humor.</strong></p>
							<p>Thank you."</p>

							<a name="carns"></a><p>"Working with Patrick was great. He really took the time to get the best sounds out of our wacky equipment without losing the wackiness. Hashing out mixes long distance was no problem--he is a com/nav master, managing somehow to wade through our swampy mess of email directions and pull out a glorious pearl. <strong>Laid-back, flexible, patient, yet supremely focused. Sharp as a tack. </strong>All around, a 100% positive experience. Thanks, Patrick!"</p>

							<p><a name="chuck"></a>"<strong>Patrick made some very subtle yet critical improvements during the mastering of the Idyll Swords' "Purposeful Availment" EP, while maintaining the delicate dynamics - not an easy task when mastering an acoustic record.</strong> He was very open about his working methods and he even pointed out some issues in my monitoring setup that subsequently led to some much improved mixes. The result was the Swords' best release, sonically. I'm glad we crossed paths with Patrick and I would definitely work with him again."</p>

							<p>"The masters sounds really good for these songs. Patrick did a great job with them. The tracks were recorded live in a room all together including vocals so that's where our mixes were coming from - <strong>he did a nice job in bringing the instruments out and giving them their voice.</strong><br/> I approve~!!!"</p>

							<p>"Klem made the recording and mastering process surprisingly easy. <strong>In the past, I've used relatively expensive studios with amazing amounts of equipment. The results we got from Klem actually surpassed those studios. </strong>Working with Klem was as relaxing as hanging out with a friend yet he maintained a professional attitude and put in the hours to make the recording and mastering sound excellent."</p>

							<p>"Recording with Patrick ran far more smoothly than I could have hoped. His documentary approach makes the process of recording almost disappear--you're just playing your songs in a room. His gear is well-chosen, well-maintained, and he knows it well, so for a band with a couple of recording geeks, it was nice to not have to worry too much about that end of things. He balances professionalism and a genuinely twisted sense of humor, <strong>and was never satisfied until we were. </strong>Great work ethic, great guy.  A shame about that horrible deformity."</p>

							<p>"Like finding the right pair of shoes, the perfect meal, the best year of Old Pappy, I would be A-OK only recording with Patrick from here on out.<br/>

			<p>Patrick went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable while we were in the studio, <strong>lending direction when needed, while never being pushy. </strong>I was pleasantly surprised to find he had no agenda other than to make us sound the way we did tracking live. From start to finish he went with all we asked of him, changing things on the fly, never telling us we couldn't do something (unless it meant magically removing something from all but one room mic). For the first time that I can recall, we actually spent more time tracking than we did waiting around to do so.</p>

			<p>The only disappointment I have is that I can't complain about how the recording sounds, instead I have to focus on how poorly I play guitar and sing."</p>

Patrick Klem is one I have worked with very recently and his work measures up to any and all bar none. </strong>He has an incredibly perceptive ear and was able to bring out the elements I was looking for, with a bare minimum of instruction. His shaping of the final product was such that it took on a vibrancy and life that even surpassed my high expectations."</p>

							<a name="gunn"></a><p>"I am grateful to the friend who recommended that I take my new solo album "Boerum Palace" for Three Lobed Recordings to Patrick for mastering. I really needed help to improve the sound quality on certain tracks, and Patrick made some very helpful suggestions. His technical expertise and keen ear for the music was exactly what I was looking for to help make these recordings sound better. I knew what I wanted to do, but couldn't verbalize it technically. <strong>Patrick understood my intentions and his suggestions were clear and helpful, something I can take with me on future recording projects. </strong>I will certainly work with Patrick again on future projects and will recommend him to those who are looking for an intuitive, solid mastering job. <strong>His final master was better than I could have hoped for; he allowed this record to reach its full potential."</strong></p>

							<a name="klaine"></a><p>"I was tripping working with Patrick Klem; it was an amazing experience and the best thing is that I learned a lot for future work. The dialogue and decision-making process between us was very fast, completely honest, without ego, without laziness, and never left me waiting without knowing what will happen next - just pure efficient collaboration. Patrick has an amazing ability to quickly understand what I am searching for, the kind of sound I want, the grain and color I wish to hear, the dynamics I want to keep or increase, <strong>all with a sincere respect for the deepest obsessions I have towards my sound. He was able to take my concerns and offer multiple solutions, but was never stuck in an endless experimentation / decision paralysis. Whenever I ask him about his decisions, he can always explain the acoustical/technical and emotional/aesthetic answers to the tiniest detail.</strong> Patrick Klem should be a 'must be' for your CD and vinyl.  I loved working with him and I hope we will work again together in the future.</p>

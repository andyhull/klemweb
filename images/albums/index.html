						<h2>Rates</h2>
							<p>Length of project in minutes - $6 (new client) / $5 (returning client) per minute of audio</p>
							<p>Setup fee - $25<br>
							This fee covers project load-in, any conversions, and archiving.  Need those original mixes or mastered files five years from now?  Not a problem...</p>
							<p>Production masters - $20/disc (includes packaging and postage)<br>
							A production master is used by the duplication house for the mass production of vinyl records or CDs and is thoroughly tested for errors. It should not be used for casual listening or for making copies, rather, it should remain sealed and opened only by the duplication house.  Every production master is accompanied by a PQ data sheet (listing of time codes) and we are happy to encode your ISRCs on audio CDs.<br>
							Even if the final delivery format is data files / e-delivery / anything besides an audio CD, this fee is still charged as any production master still requires assembling the sequence, spacers, accompanying time code sheet, printing the files according to the plant's specifications, and FTP'ing the files to the plant.  <i>However, we'll waive this charge if the vinyl is a single song for each and every side of the project</i>.</p>
							<p>Listening copies (PMCD) - one disc free if mailed to same location as the production master, otherwise $5/disc (includes packaging and postage)<br>
							While the listening copy is created under the same conditions as the production master, it does not undergo the same level of error-checking required for a production master.<br>
							If you have a high-speed internet connection and/or are an international client, we can upload the files for your evaluation, which can reduce or eliminate charges for listening copies.</p>
							<p>If the project will be released on multiple formats (e.g., vinyl and CD), it is ideal to optimize them as such. Please add $30 for processing, as well as $20 for the second production master (includes one PMCD).  More info on the differences between the vinyl and digital formats is available <a href="considerations.pdf">here</a>.</p>
							<p>We can create mp3s of your project.  These will be encoded at 320CBR via the LAME codec (v. 3.97), and properly tagged (based on the information you supply).  Please add $2/track.</p>							
							<p>As opposed to many mastering facilities, Klemflastic Sound offers:</p>
							<strong><p>Fast turn-around time:<br></strong>
							First passes are routinely sent out within a week.</p>
							<strong><p>Free revisions:<br></strong>
							Albeit infrequent, any and all revisions are free; your satisfaction is our goal.</p>
							<strong><p>Free sample:<br></strong>
							We are happy to provide a free sample - feel free to send a track to us, and we'll send a portion of a mastered version back.</p>
							<p>Accounts must be paid in full prior to releasing the first pass listening copy for approval. Payment can be made via paypal (add 4%, and send to klem at klemflastic dot com), in cash, or via personal check (however, we wait for the check to clear before releasing work). Contact Klemflastic Sound for our mailing address.</p>
